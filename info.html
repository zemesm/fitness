                    <h5>Nutrition</h5>
                    <h3>Calorie</h3>
                    <p>It is an unit of energy that human bodies need to survive.</p>
                    <p>Calories are contained in foods and we use them for energy.</p>
                    <h3>Calorie deficit / cutting</h3>
                    <p>A state where you lose weight (muscle or fat), it happens when you burn more calories per day that you use.</p>
                    <h3>Calorie surplus / bulking</h3>
                    <p>A state where you gain weight (muscle or fat), it happens when you burn less calories per day than you use.</p>
                    <h3>Macronutrients / macros</h3>
                    <p>Nutrients that a human body uses in the highest amount (proteins, carbohydrates, fats).</p>
                    <h3>Protein</h3>
                    <p>A macronutrient that is used to repair and grow a human body.</p>

                    <h3>Law of evergy balance</h3>
                    <p>A basic principle that says that when you burn more energy (calories) than you expand, you lose weight (fat/muscle) and when you take in more energy (calories) than you burn, you gain weight (fat/muscle).</p>
                    <h3>Harris Benedict formula</h3>
                    <p>A method that takes into account a few individual factors, such as your height, age, weight ... to set you a dily requirement of calories.</p>

                    <h3>Volume</h3>
                    <p>How much work you do, such as the number of repetitions (reps) you perform of an exercise.</p>
                    <h3>Intensity</h3>
                    <p>Intensity describes the difficulty of an exercise, typically based on the amount of weight you lift.</p>

                    <h3>Rest - Pause sets</h3>
                    <p>An advanced bodybuilding technique that sees you taking your sets as close to absolute failure as you safely can, however many reps it takes, before taking short, 'pauses' and continuing on, again aiming for failure.</p>
                    <h3>Dropsets</h3>
                    <p>A drop set is an advanced resistance training technique in which you focus on completing a set until failure, then, you lighten the load by 10 to 30 percent, and repeat, with no rest in between sets. </p>
                    <h3>Supersets</h3>
                    <p>The concept of a superset is to perform 2 exercises back to back with no </p>

                    <p>Stands for Time under tension.</p>
                    <p>It indicates how much time during your set your muscles are under tension.</p>
                    <h3>Concentric part of the movement</h3>
                    <p>In a concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance then remains stable as the muscle shortens.</p>
                    <h3>Eccentric part of the movement</h3>
                    <p>Eccentric phase is the portion following the isometric phase, in which the muscle is lengthened under load to return to its starting position. </p>
                    <h3>Isometric phase</h3>
                    <p>The isometric phase is the portion of dynamic movement where no change in muscle length takes place.</p>

                <h1>Nutrition Explained</h1>
                <p>Here is the information we provide</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>How to lose fat</h3>
                    <p>Nowaday there are many diets promoted by many people (carnivore, paleo, low fat, keto ...), but when it comes down to it, all the diets are just methods that help people lower their calories and get them into calorie deficit easier.</p>
                    <p>The most important thing to understand is the concept of calories and calorie deficit and that the only state when you lose weight, is when you consume less calories than you burn over periods of time.</p>
                    <p>While exercising is certainly beneficial for fat loss, it is not the only thing that needs to be taken into account, because training will only add up a smaller portion of your burnt calories throughout the day, but if your nutrition is out of check it is most likely that you will not lose weight because you are not in a calorie deficit.</p>
                    <p>For some people sticking to rules, such as not eating carbs (fruits, rice, potatoes, sweets ...) or eating just meets makes this more simple so they follow these kinds of diets, when all you really need is to establish the amount of calories that you should eat and then eat slightly less.</p>
                    <p>When people learn the basics, they can control their diet and combine all kinds of foods and still reach their goals.</p>
                    <p>I believe that this method is the most applicable to most people, because when you learn what is in your foods and count calories, nothing is off limits, you just eat and you are aware of what you are getting in.</p>
                    <p>This kind of "diet" or style is called IIFYM which stands for if it fits your macros or else called flexible dieting.</p>
                    <p>The main point in IIFYM is to hit the total daily caloric and macronutrient needs.</p>
                    <p>The only downsight that discourages people is the fact that it is based off of tracking your calories and therefore you have to count your calories and macros.</p>
                    <p>I believe that this is the best way for people to lose weight or gain muscle, if its not taken to the extremes that some consider as IIFYM, when its actually not in the concept, because you are not hitting your macros and micros.</p>
                    <p>As extremes I would define eating just sweets and junk in small amounts throughout the day and not eating anything else to fit their caloric needs, but as you can imagine, this is just not healthy in many ways even though it leads to losing weight.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative is eating just so called "clean" foods or "healthy" foods which may be healthier for the body, it is not really healthy for the mind and I dont think it is applicable to most people.</p>
                    <p>The way that this "diet" is meant to work is that people following it should eat the majority of foods that are healthy and sometimes add something that is viewed unhealthy while still reaching their calories, macros and micros, not as an excuse to eat an unhealthy diet.</p>
                    <p>Many people ally the 80/20 rule which says that 80 percent of your diet should be clean and 20 percent of your diet can be in unhealthy foods.</p>
                    <p>Even fast food such as cheeseburger contains valid macronutrients and proteins and it doesnt make you fat, its always that too many cheeseburgers that make you fat because of theirs high fat content and therefore high calorie content.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>When you eat and apple, or a candy bar, your body cant really identify it as a healthy or unhelthy, all it really does is that it breaks foods down to calories, macronutrients and micronutrients and uses it to function.</p>

                <div class="three">
                    <h3>How to track calories</h3>
                    <p>Tracking calories is a term now known to many people, but it is the best way to find out what you really eat on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>Start by installing any tracking app to your phone, such as myfitnesspal.</p>
                    <p>Now you can log anything that you eat.</p>
                    <p>Imagine you ate a roll with butter and deli meat on it for breakfast.</p>
                    <p>You start by weighing your food on the kitchen scale and you find out how many grams does each food you ate have.</p>
                    <p>Then you simply search for the given food in the app and you write down how many grams you ate and it automatically counts how many calories and macros were in your food.</p>
                    <p>On most of the processed food, there are even bar codes that you can sacn, so that you dont have to find each individual item.</p>
                    <p>Later on, when you get more experienced, you will remember some foods so you will not have to weigh all your food, but you will know it by hearth or you will be able to estimate accurately.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Setting your calories and macros</h3>
                    <p>If you are setting your calories for the first time, it is always going to be a complete guess.</p>
                    <p>The process starts with about a week of simply eating as usually, but writing down the foods you eat into an app such as myfitnesspal and learning how many calories you take in.</p>
                    <p>After your first week of tracking, you make an average of calories you ate during this week.</p>
                    <p>If you want to skip this week of guessing what you are eating, you can simply multiply your bodyweight in pounds by 14-15 and try adhering to those calories.</p>
                    <p>The third possibility is to search for an online calorie calculator, input your information and adhere to the number it generates based on you, but understand that most of the online calculators are quite inaccurate.</p>
                    <p>Lets say you got a number of 2000 calories per day.</p>
                    <p>Now you can set your macronutrients in your app.</p>
                    <p>Firstly you determine your protein by your pounds, then you divide the remaining calories between fats (25 percent) and carbs (50 percent).</p>
                    <p>These values can change from person to persen depending on their preferences, but I am simply trying to spread out macronutrients like most people regularly eat.</p>
                    <p>You should eat 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight.</p>
                    <p>In my case right now, it is about 125g of protein.</p>
                    <p>1g of protein has 4 calories, so 125g of protein has 500 calories, now you have 1500 left.</p>
                    <p>25 percent of your diet is 500 calories, divide that by 9 because 1g of fat has 9 calories and you get aproximately 55 grams of fat.</p>
                    <p>Whats left are the carbohydrates, which are 50 percent of your calories or 1000 calories, divide that by 4, because 1g of carbs has 4 calories and you get about 250 grams of carbs.</p>
                    <p>Now you have a plan, where if you eat 2000 calories and you weigh 215 pounds, you should eat 125g of protein, 250g of carbs and 55g of fat daily.</p>
                    <p>If we count again just to make sure, we have 125*4 + 250*4 + 55*9 and that equals to 1995 calories which is almost perfectly 2000.</p>
                    <p>After 2 weeks of adhering to your claories, you can see if your weight has moved up, down, or stayed the same.</p>
                    <p>You can update your calories according to your goal, if you want to lose weight decrease your calories by 100-200 and if you want to gain weight increase them by 100-200 and after 2 weeks check if your updated calorie plan is taking you to your goals or not.</p>

            </div>

                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Gain muscle, not fat</h3>
                    <p>When wanting to add more muscle to your frame, you will most likely end up adding some fat in the process as well, but it can be minigated by doing things right.</p>
                    <p>Gaining muscle always requires a calorie surplus, but having 100 percent of these calories converted to muscle is just not possible.</p>
                    <p><span>The first</span> thing you can do is to control your calorie surplus to a minimum required amount of calories to gain muscle.</p>
                    <p>What this means is to choose a small surplus of roughly 10 percent of your daily intake (for example going from 2000 cal per day to 2200).</p>
                    <p><span>The second</span> thing is implementing a proper weightlifting program.</p>
                    <p>This is important because muscle needs to be stimulated to grow as I have mentioned previously.</p>
                    <p>If a person is not exercising properly (not enough intensity, progression, volume, poor form ...) most of the given surplus gets converted to fat rather than muscle.</p>
                    <p><span>The third</span> thing that is important is to implement some kind of cardio to your routine.</p>
                    <p>Bonus cardio will keep your hearth in a good shape and help you burn some extra calories, so that you can eat more.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>if there is not enough stimulus for muscle to grow, or just too many calories, it is simply like laying on a coach eating an excess of calories expecting muscle to grow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Healthy vs Good for dieting</h3>
                    <p>This topic is very confising for most people.</p>
                    <p>People generally believe that if they eat healthy, they lose weight.</p>
                    <p>While this works for some people, it just doesnt mean its the truth.</p>
                    <p>Foods can be divided into groups in 2 aspects, if they are healthy or not, or if they are good for dieting or not.</p>
                    <p>Foods that are healthy contain many micronutriends that a human body needs to function and unhealthy foods dont contain many micronutrients, but both of these groups can contain any amount of calories.</p>
                    <p>Foods that are good for dieting are low in calories and foods that are not good for dieting are high in calories, but even so both of these groups can contain any amount of micronutrients.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If you eat an avocado, it is really healthy for you, because it contains many healthy fats, but it is not really good for dieting, because it contains many calories.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you eat a jello sweetened with arteficial sweeteners, it is not really healthy in any way for your body, but it satiates you and it does not have almost any calories, so it is good for you to lose weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Proper protein intake</h3>
                    <p>Protein is important for many processes in human body such as muscle recovery and growth.</p>
                    <p>It is shown, that an intake of 0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight is the maximum that your body need for maximum muscle recovery and growth.</p>
                    <p>If you are more overweight you can easily get by by eating 0.8 grams pr pound of bodyweight and if you are more lean with a bigger amounts of muscle you might benefit from going to 1.2 grams per pound of bodyweight because protein intake is ultimately based on lean body mass.</p>
                    <p>Another advantage of protein is its highest thermic offect of food of 20-30 percent (that means that if you ate 1000 calories of chicken breast aproximately 200-300 gets burnt up just digesting), it lowers levels of ghrellin (hunger hormone) in your body and it is also the most satisfying macronutrient what is very beneficial when cutting.</p>
                    <p>There are some missleading information about negative side effects of protein (kidney and liver damage), but none of them were actually confirmed.</p>
                    <p>The only major side effect of extreme high protein diet or a meal can be laxative effects.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Maximum protein limit per meal</h3>
                    <p>It is said that a human body can use a maximum of 30-50 grams of protein per meal and the rest simply goes to waste.</p>
                    <p>This is simply not the case, this myth refers to the theme discussed in Meal frequency, where people say to eat every 2-3 even though it is not as beneficial as they think.</p>
                    <p>There is no set limit for maximum protein absorbtion, but even though there is none, it is still beneficial to eat more times per day</p>
                    <p>Slow digesting proteins (egg) usually digest at a rate of 3 grams per hour and fast digesting proteins (whey) 8-10 grams per hour.</p>
                    <p>Larger meals just take longer to digest, but the protein from t hem gets used up eventually.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If the human body was designed this way, our ancestors would not be able to survive, because there were long periods of starvation and short periods of gorging when they hunt down a mamooth and so if their bodies absorbed jsut 30 grams of protein and tossed out the rest they would simply all die.</p>
                    <p>If you consume 30 grams of protein from eggs, that could mean it would take 10 hours to digest that, but it would not mean you cannot eat more protein for another 10 hours or it will be wasted.</p>
                    <p>Another this is that there are people who are having a daily protein intake of 250+ grams, so by the 30g of protein per meal rule they would have to eat more than 8 meals per day.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays fasted cardio is often pushed toward people looking to lose weight said to burn more fat than classic fed cardio.</p>
                    <p>Technically it is true that morning fasted cardio burns more fat, since fasted cardio burns fat directly and fed cardio burns carbohydrates and empties glycogen stores from the body, but in the end this fact does not really matter, since losing fat is a long process of daily caloric deficit.</p>
                    <p>If you enjoy working out on an empty stomach, because you dont feel like throwing up during your session, or if you have to eat before your cardio to have energy during your session, the outcome at the end of the day is still the same (same amount of calories burned).</p>
                    <p>The only factors that differ are that when you eat before your workout, you may go more intense on your training because you have more energy and so you burn slightly more calories and that when you dont eat for a longer period of time before your cardio, its not just fat that is used to fuel your body, but also muscle.</p>
                    <p>The only thing that is needed to be taken into account is the bigger muscle loss chance when doing cardio completely fasted when not eating for the whole night and then performing exercise without eating in the morning.</p>
                    <p>In this case any alterative you choose is going to be almost as effective as the other one and there is no need to overthing this, the only time to definitely not do cardio is immidiately before your weightlifting session because that will decrease your performance when lifting.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If you wake up, dont eat and do fasted cardio, you burn fat because your glycogen stores are empty, but when you eat after your cardio, the food comes to glycogen stores and then is stored inside your body.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you wake up, you eat and then do cardio, during your session you burn glycogen, not fat, because the food you ate is in your system and is used as energy to fuel you during your cardio, but right when you end your session, you dont eat, because you are full and now is the time when the body uses your fat as fuel, not glycogen.</p>

                    <h3>HIIT vs LISS cardio</h3>
                    <p>High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a type of cardio where a person alternates between periods of high (70 or more percent of their max capacity) and low intensity throughout the set that lasts 5-20 minutes (doing 45 sec. max speed running and then 15 sec. of walking).</p>
                    <p>Low intensity steady state (LISS) cardio is a type of cardio where a person does an activity in a way that allows them to go for longer periods of time (45-60 mins ...) without rest and without exerting their maximum effort.</p>
                    <p>To compare these two, HIIT burns a greater amount of calories in a shorter amount of time, puts a much bigger strain on the body.</p>
                    <p>The reason why HIIT cardio gets promoted very ofter is its 'afterburn effect' or Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) that causes a body to burn more calories after your workout because of its oxygen depletion.</p>
                    <p>While this might seem very good on paper, in reality it is just about 7 percent extra calorie burn, which is negligable (if you burn 350 calories in your 20 minutes (which is a lot for that time) all you burn extra is just 5 calories).</p>
                    <p>Another disadvantage of HIIT is its strain on the body. It is very ineffective to do after a heavy legs workout because of your inability to perform at your maximum and it is horrible for your recovery, when your legs are after so much stress because of the previous workout.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, steady state allows you to go for longer periods of time and therefore allows you to burn a greater amount of calories in total even if you have to use more time.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If I do HIIT sprints for 20 mins and somehow I burn 200 calories, my body is totally destroyed whereas when I do steady state running on a threadmill at a moderate pace for 60 minutes I can burn around 500 calories and my body is not as fatigued.</p>

                    <h3>Eating frequency</h3>
                    <p>While the experts say that you should eat every 2-3 hours to maximize muscle protein synthesis, you get almost the same effect eating 3-5 meals spaced equally throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>As long as you hit your total macronutrient intake per day, it will have a minimal benefit eating more that 5 times per day.</p>
                    <p>Digestion is a very gradual process and most of the time when you eat you still do not have your previous meal completely digested.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If I ate 3 main meals per day and 1 or 2 small snacks it would have almost the same effect as if I ate 6 or 7 small main meals throughout the day</p>

                    <h3>Spot fat reduction/Toning</h3>
                    <p>It is not possible to specifically target and lose fat from specific areas in human body.</p>
                    <p>Losing fat is occuring only while being in a calorie deficit in the body as a whole, in some places more that others depending on your genetics.</p>
                    <p>It it was possible, it would mean that doing bicep curls would burn fat from your biceps.</p>
                    <p>Muscle and fat are 2 completely different tissues.</p>
                    <p>Training is just stimulating muscles, making them bigger, dieting is 'toning muscles' or removing fat making them look more sharp and visible.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>Everybody has a six-pack that is covered underneath a layer of fat.</p>
                    <p>Making the best looking six-pack is a combination of training abdominals to make them bigger and reducing the amount of fat on your stomach to make muscles show more.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Getting rid of stomach fat</h3>
                    <p>When trying to achieve a muscular fit physique, the last finishing touch is a lean defined mid section.</p>
                    <p>A human body is genetically programmed for storing a greater percentage of fat on our stomachs.</p>
                    <p>As we have discussed previously in the topic of "toning" there is no way to remove fat from your stomach specifically, because it all comes down to losing fat from your body as a whole and based on your genetics, workout regimen and calorie deficit you are going to lose fat from your abdominals eventually.</p>
                    <p>When working out your abs, you are making them stronger and bigger, but to see them more defined and sharp, you have to lose the layer of fat surrounding them.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If I want the best six pack, all you can do is train your abs until you are satisfied with the amount of muscle there and eat in a calorie deficit until the layer of fat on your stomach is as thin as you would like.</p>

                    <h3>Pre workout nutrition.</h3>
                    <p>The main functions of a pre-workout meal is to maximize training performance during your session and to provide your bodynutrients to recover after your workout.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this, the most beneficial are carbohydrates for energy and proteins for muscle recovery.</p>
                    <p>I would recommend keeping fat content to the absolute minimum, because it slows down the rate at which you digest the foods you ate and therefore you might feel bloated during your workout.</p>
                    <p>When it comes down to timing, you should consume your workout meal when is the most convenient for the best energy and stomach comfort for you (msot often 1,5-2 h. prior training).</p>
                    <p>If eating before your workout just does not sit wel with you and you prefer training fasted, you do not have to eat before your workouts even if it is not as beneficial as training fed.</p>
                    <p>Some people even add bigger amounts of salt to their pre workout meal or they just mix it with water and quickly drink it, becuase salt inceases pump during your workount and so if that is what you are looking for, definitely incorporate it into your refimen.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, you should intake a mix of cars and proteins before your workout for maximum performance and recovery.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Post workout nutrition</h3>
                    <p>Many people believe that you need to consume protein and carbs fast after working out to get  the advantage so called "anabolic window"</p>
                    <p>Carbs are believed to be needed after the workout to replenish glycogen levels after a hard workout, but this is simply not necessary, because a heavy weightlifting session depletes maximally about 30 percent of your glycogen stores.</p>
                    <p>Fast carbs after workouts may benefit professional athletes who workout the same muscles multiple times per day, but for average people exercising their muscle groups 2-3 times per week the benefit is very minimal.</p>
                    <p>The most hype concerning post workout nutrition is concerning the anabolic window rule, which says to eat protein immidiately after your workout because your body "absorbes the protein like a sponge".</p>
                    <p>This theory is simply put missguided and while protein after your workout will not minigate your progress, it is simply not a necessity and as long as you are eating a balanced diet divided between 3-5 meals you are all set because of the graduality of protein absorption.</p>

                    <h3>When to cut and when to bulk</h3>
                    <p>To firstly explain what each process means, cutting means eating less calories than you burn (being in a calorie deficit) and burning as much muscle and as little fat as possible and bulking means eating more calories than you burn (being in a calorie surplus) and gaining as much muscle and as little fat as possible.</p>
                    <p>Many people start their fitness journey not looking as good as they want and for some deciding what to do feels easy (if they are overweight they want to lose weight and if they are just too skinny they want to put on muscle), but for some it is more tricky to determine if they want to lose fat at first and then build more muscle or to do it the other way.</p>
                    <p>As a general guideline I would recommend starting a bulk at around 12 percent body fat or less, but most people can not determine their body fat percentage accurately, so this tip will most likely be useless to most people that are not experienced enough.</p>
                    <p>When deciding if you should bulk or cut, you should determine your priorities and then look at yourself in the mirror and acnowledge that if you are going to bulk, you are going to add muscle to your frame, but even some fat in most cases and if you are going to cut you will lose fat and most likely some muscle in the process.</p>
                    <p>As a complete beginner it is definitely possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time, but this process is way more gradual than people think and most peaople want to focus on one goal (bulk or cut) and not hover around their maintanance in hopes for good results.</p>
                    <p>If you compare the advantages and disadvantages of cutting and bulking, the answer should come to you on its own if you want to get bigger or smaller right now.</p>
                    <p>If getting more fat on you will be uncomfortable, then you should focus on cutting first and if you do not want to get any smaller than you already are and you feel like you want to add muscle to your frame and get bigger you should focs on bulking.</p>
                    <p>In the end, what your goals are is ultimately up to you and even if you start one or the other process, you can always choose to pick the other one a while into your phase, just make sure you are not jumping from one to another every week.</p>

                    <h3>Progressive overlaod</h3>
                    <p>It is the most fundamental principle of building mucsle.</p>
                    <p>The law of progressive overload states that you must train with a sufficient amount of intensity to stimulate your muscle growth and that you must consistently increase the amount of weight lifted over periods of time to gain strength.</p>
                    <p>What this means is to train hard, increase the intensity and weight over time, get closer to failure and results will come.</p>
                    <p>Muscles adapt to the amount of stress (reps, weight ...), and so you need to progress over the time.</p>
                    <p>Without knowing what you did in the gym the last time it is very hard to progressively overload.</p>
                    <p>A good idea is to look at how many reps you did the last time in the gym and simply try to do 1 more.</p>
                    <p>After your repetitions are too high for your goal you can simply add weight and do the same process again.</p>
                    <p>When doing this day by day, week by week, month by month and year by year, you will be shocked how far you can get just by aplying this simple principle.</p>
                    <p>You can track your workouts with a notebook or in your phone for example in excel sheets.</p>
                    <p>When doing this right, you enter the gym every time with a clear visual of what you did yesterday and what you need to do today.</p>
                    <p>Without doing this, you have no way of knowing wheather you are physically improving or not.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>When you go to the gym, write down exactly how much weight and reps you did and try to beat it the next time you do the same exercise.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Muscle soreness and growth</h3>
                    <p>Muscle soreness has almost nothing to wheather or not you successfully stimulated your muscles in the gym.</p>
                    <p>It is not a result of a damage to the muscle tissue, but rather to the connective tissue.</p>
                    <p>Another variables in the intensity of your soreness is for example the experience level of a lifter, which muscle you train and many more factors.</p>
                    <p>As your body gets used to training you get gradually less sore from your workouts and therefore we can not say that beginners tend to have more effective workouts even though they usually get more sore that experienced lifers.</p>
                    <p>Insted of focusing if you are sore or not, you should simply focus on your intensity and progressive overload.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If we compare my set of squats, there are days when I do not really get sore, but if I would just skip the gym and did jumping jacks for half an hour insted, I would for sure get sure jsut because I am not used to this kind of activity.</p>

                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Muscle/Strength imbalancements</h3>
                    <p>Many people have one side of their body stronger than the other.</p>
                    <p>While this is common mostly for begiining lifters, this issue can be found to some degree even in senior lifters.</p>
                    <p><span>The first</span> tip would be to practice mostly unilateral movements, or simpler said doing exercises, that require a persone to move one part of the body, then the other (lunges).</p>
                    <p>When doing these movements, the muscle imbalancements will fade away gradually as each side of your body adapts to the weight.</p>
                    <p><span>The second</span> tip would be to always start with the weaker side of the body first and when you hit failure, thats where you end even with the other part of your body.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If your left arm is weaker than the right arm, you choose switching dumbbell curls instead of barebell curls, you start with your left arm and continue doing one rep with left arm, then one rep with your right arm ... and when you hit failure with your left arm, you do one more rep with your right arm to make reps even and then you stop performing the exercise.</p>

                    <h3>Changing workout plans</h3>
                    <p>This concept is also differently known as "muscle confusion", where people believe changing their exercises, reps, workouts ... is going to shock muscles into bigger growth.</p>
                    <p>This comes from theory that muscles need to be shocked to receive a new stimulus for growth, but in reality all its doing is making it harder for you to remember what weight/reps did you do oon a given exercise and therefore it makes it harder for you to check your progress.</p>
                    <p>If you want to switch workouts from your satisfactory standpoint, its a perfectly valit point to switch workouts from time to time, but I would not recommend changing them very often, definitely not for "muscle confusion".</p>
                    <p>From muscle improvement standpoint, generally the more irregularities you add to your workout, the less effective the outcome.</p>
                    <p>It is even possible to eternally progress on 1 workout program, focusing on proper form, weight, reps, intensity, eating right and resting well, there is no need to switch workouts if things are working fine as they are.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If you always change your workout plan, you can not guess what weight you should pick and so you end up doing less intense workout or you just switch the weight witch the exercise that you are already doing, but you dont rightly estimate where your failure is and so you dont have as efficient workout, because you are not going close enough to faiure.</p>

                    <h3>Factors causing plateaus and minigate progress</h3>
                    <p><span>Insufficient calorie intake</span> is one of the common factors for not making progress in the gym, because when you dont eat enough, your body cant adapt and get stronger.</p>
                    <p><span>Inadequate training intensity</span> is the most common issue whz most lifters dont see the results thez want, simplz because thez dont put enough effort to their exercises.</p>
                    <p><span>Poor form</span> is one of the factors, that not only hold people back from achieving progress, but can even set people back weeks or months because of injuries due to proper execution of movements in the gym.</p>
                    <p><span>Improper rest</span> is also very common, because many people tend to go to the gym, do set after set with no rest in between and expect their body to recover when in reality it is just not possible and so they do not push as big of a weight as they could if they rested for 2 more minutes between sets.</p>
                    <p><span>Injuries</span> are a very unpredictable factor, as they come very unexpectedly, but even so, it is better to heal them first and them push your body further (with reservations if needed).</p>
                    <p><span>Overtraining</span> is one of the least commom factor, because most people want to find the easiest way to success, while only few overwork themeselves, but even so, muscles are broked down in the gym, but they grow stronger while resting.</p>

                    <h3>Rest between sets</h3>
                    <p>Rest between sets depends on many factors, such as which muscles you train, if you go heavy or light reps...</p>
                    <p>The rest times vary very differently between a set of bicep curls and a set of heavy deadlifts.</p>
                    <p>Starting from the shortest rest time, when doing isolation movements in moderate to light reps, all you really need is 1-2 min. rest.</p>
                    <p>When doing moderate reps at compound movements such as bench press or dumbbell press, you should take rests of 2-3 mins to fully recover for your next set.</p>
                    <p>As the bigger extreme I would take to account powerlifters, who lift very heavy in low rep ranges and say that to fully recover their strength for the next set they need a rest of even 5 minutes to recover.</p>
                    <p>In your workouts, you can always apply different rest times and rep ranges between different exerices and get the most of it.</p>

                    <h3>Principles of creating a workout program</h3>
                    <p>Creating your own workout program might be quite tricky, because there are many variables that have to be taken into account, but after some time, you will get it right.</p>
                    <p>Firstly you should think of how many times per week and for how much time should your workouts take.</p>
                    <p>After this, you should keep in mind, that you should work out each muscle 2-3 times per week and you need more exercises for bigger muscles than for the smaller ones.</p>
                    <p>Then, I would base my workout program on heavier compound movements first such as bench press, squats, deadlift... and then add some addditional work for these or other muscles.</p>
                    <p>You can always start you workout with a compound movement, because it is going to be the hardest and you will need the most power to go through it.</p>
                    <p>I will not be covering the exact amount of repetitions, because that is based on your goals and explained in section with rep ranges, but I will say to do heavier lifts first and then move on to higher rep training in your workout because of strength benefits and even injury prevention.</p>
                    <p>You can base your workouts around your rest times and fill in as much exercises as you have to reach your time that you set for your workout per day.</p>
                    <p>For some, it is going to be higher weight and longer rest, for some its gonna be the opposite, but ultimately, you should start with heavier work, then move to higher reps, include all body parts, get proper rest times and focus on intensity and progression over time.</p>

                    <h3>Slow vs Fast reps</h3>
                    <p>The most important thing to keep in mind is to be in control of every rep of every exercise you do for hypertrophy and safety reasons.</p>
                    <p>The goal of hypertrophy is to put as much tension and overload on the muscle as possible and if you are letting gravity do the work, or just swing the weight to get more reps and other muscle groups are taking over you are just wasting your time.</p>
                    <p>When you are completely in conrol of the weight, the speed does not really matter that much but keep in mind that the ideal time of tension during a set for hypertrophy is between 40-60 second.</p>
                    <p>The lift can be divided into the concentric part of the movement where you push/pull the weight and the eccentric part where you lower the weights.</p>
                    <p>The overall rule is that the concentric part can be faster/more explosive, but the eccentric part should be more slow/controlled to feel the muscle more (2-3 sec. each rep).</p>
                    <p>To increase the time under tension (TUT), there are many ways such as dropsets or simply stopping in the contracted position.</p>

                    <h3>Training from home</h3>
                    <p>Wheather you have a busy schedule and dont want to waste time driving to the gym, or you dont want to pay for membership or you just dont feel the best exercising surrounded by people, there is always an alternative of training at home.</p>
                    <p>When beginning, you will be able to perform many exrcises (mostly calisthenic) with your own weight, but in the future, there will be a need to invest in some equipement for you to use and progress.</p>
                    <p>To start I would suggest buying a barebell, adjustable dumbbells and sets of plates, because with this you can target any muscle you want in different ways.</p>
                    <p>If you want to go further, you can also buy an adjustable bench and a set of squat supporters, which you can use for squats and even for your bench presses.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, if you dont want to be traveling to your nearest outside workout playground, you should buy a pull up bar witch a belt for weights and consider even dips bars, because each of these is not really that expensive and can add on more exercises to your limited list.</p>
                    <p>As I have mentioned in my previous statement, there is another alternative of not working out from home, but if you have a workout playground near your house, it is also a perfect valid way of exercising completely for free.</p>

                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                    <p>Triceps is divided into 3 heads: the medial, lateral and long head.</p>
                    <p>Biceps is divided into 2 heads: the long and short heads. In the inside is another muscle that is often forgotten called brachialis.</p>

                    <h3>Optimal sleep</h3>
                    <p>Sleeping is one of the most often overlooked factors when trying to lose weight or build muscle.</p>
                    <p>Optimal sleep schedule keeps your energy levels in check, improves your mood and motivation.</p>
                    <p>For bodybuilding purposes proper sleep is important for optimization of testosterone and growth hormone levels and insulin sensitivity (which improves nutrition partitioning).</p>
                    <p>While most people go for the recommended average of 8 hours of sleep per day, the ideal amount is a highly individual thing and therefore people should test what any given time of sleeping feels like for them and then based around these results the should determine how much sleed they usually need.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>When I sleep 7-9 hours I feel the best, if I sleep less that 6 hours I feel terrible and I cant focus and if I sleep more thant 9-10 hours I feel tired and sluggish so I always try to sleep 7-9 hours per day.</p>

                    <h3>Pump and muscle growth</h3>
                    <p>For those who do not already know, pump is a state when your blood flow is increased in your muscles when you train and so your muscles are bigger and feel like swelled up.</p>
                    <p>Some people think that pump is what builds muscle and directly chase for the best pump possible (consumption of salt before workouts, training in really high rep ranges, little rest ...) but pump should be rather looked at as a by product of intense training.</p>
                    <p>You should not directly chase for it, but enjoy it along the way throughout your insane properly structured workout, because a good pump is not directly correlated to bigger muscle gains, but progressive overload is.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>If I did 1000 jumping jacks the pump on my legs would be bigger than doing a set of heavy squats but the set of squats is way more beneficial for muscle growth than jumping jacks.</p>

                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Training when cutting vs Training when bulking</h3>
                    <p>Some people believe that when they are bulking, they should prioritize strength and mo more low rep work to build strength and muscle and that when they are cutting they should ditch low rep sets and do mostly if not only high rep sets to burn fat.</p>
                    <p>While there is some truth to it, it is not all there is to it and it is often missinterpreted.</p>
                    <p>If you are cutting, it is true that you should do less low rep strength sets, but that is because in low rep sets there is a bigger chance of injury and when you are fatigued on low calories low on energy, there is a bigger chance for injury that when bulking and because it is harder to progress with your weight and reps when you are dieting and losing weight.</p>
                    <p>These are the main reasons why people should do less low rep work, not because you are "toning" your muscles when cutting.</p>
                    <p>As I have stated before, with training you are stimulating the muscle for it to grow bigger and with your calorie deficit you are getting rid of fat surrounding the muscle to make them more sharp and visible, you are not in the gym to move as much as possible and burn as much calories as possible, because this should be the result of your dieting and cardio, you are in the gym to build/maintain muscle.</p>
                    <p>Overally, when going from cut to bulk or vice versa, your training regimen should always stay the same or very close to it with minimal changes.</p>

                <div class="three">
                    <h3>Optimal biceps training</h3>
                    <p>Biceps already gets the most of its stimulation from compound pulling movements as pull ups, pulldown or rows when you are doing your back workouts, because of their support to pull movements.</p>
                    <p>Because of this and because biceps is a relativelly small muscle group there is no need for endless bicep training volume, but some direct work is for sure necessary.</p>
                    <p>Biceps consists of a short (inner portion) and long head (outer portion), they are both heavily involved in curling movements.</p>
                    <p>The functions of biceps are the flexion of the elbow (curling movement - bb curls) and the supination of a forearm (twisting movement - twisting db curls) and so for optimal results all you need are 2 exercises for both of these functions (2-4 sets per workout if going to failure or 6-8 sets if going 1-2 reps short of failure) with the number of repetitions according to your goals.</p>

                    <h3>Protein Powder / whey</h3>
                    <p>Protein powder is a natural component of diary that is removed and isolated into powder form.</p>
                    <p>Many people who are not into lifting have no knowledge of it and almost think that it is close to steroids, when in reality, its completely false.</p>
                    <p>You should not view protein as something different than your food, but rather as a convenient food choice, you should make it a part of your diet only when needed to hit your total protein goal for the day.</p>
                    <p>It is not necessary to take in protein each day, for example if you eat greek yoghurt for breakfast, a lot of chicken for lunch, eggs in the afternoon and finish your day also witch a bigger portion of chicken, your protein intake is most likely hit by the end of the day and so there is no need for further supplementation.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays there are even many flavoured verions of protein and so you can use it as a tasty snack after your main meal and actually enjoy it.</p>
                    <p>Another good way of using protein powder is when you are busy and cant take time to prepare or eat a proper meal, you can simply drink a shake with protein and get some quick nutrition in.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to timing, if you want to be really precise the best time to supplement protein powder is after or before your workout, or simply in the morning after a longer period of not eating because of its fast absorption, but this is not a rule and definitely not a necessity.</p>
                    <p>Another benefits are its high satisfaction levels and lowering hunger hormone ghrellin levels in your body.</p>
                    <p>Even when protein has the highest bioavailability (the most percentage of the protein fully digested and used) of any other protein sources and has the highest concentration of anabolic amino acids (L-Lucine), it is not required to build muscle and you should include it in your diet only if you want to, not because you have to.</p>
